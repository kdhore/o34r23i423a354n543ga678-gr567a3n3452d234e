classdef Decisions
    % This is the decision class.  The input to this class is all the
    % YearData objects as well as the OJGame object.  It then sets the
    % properties values of this class to the decisions. This can obviously
    % call other functions or have other inputs from other functions as
    % we deem fit. It can also take as input any sort of metrics and such
    % that we have calculated from any other function or class.
